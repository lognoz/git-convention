;; --- Implementation

(define (matched-component)

    (for/list ([component (context-ref 'components)]
               #:break matched-component)

          (when (= matched-length staged-files-length)
            (set! matched-component title)))))

;; --- Hook

(when (and (context? 'components) (context? 'default-component))
